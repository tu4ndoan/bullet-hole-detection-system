"""### Tips for Target Detection:
1. **Manual Point Selection**: You can use `cv2.selectROI()` to manually select the region of the target and extract the corners, or use `cv2.selectPoly()` for polygonal selections.
   
2. **Edge Detection / Contour Detection**: If you want the system to automatically detect the target, you could use edge detection (`cv2.Canny()`) followed by contour detection (`cv2.findContours()`) to find the target’s corners.

3. **Feature Matching**: If the target has distinctive features, you can use keypoint detection and matching (e.g., using SIFT or ORB) to identify the target’s location.

### Example of Automatic Target Detection (Using Contours):
```python
"""
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read the image
image = cv2.imread('./Images/Lane1/BiaSo4-1-0.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply edge detection
edges = cv2.Canny(gray, 50, 150)

# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Assuming the largest contour is the target, find the bounding box of the target
contour = max(contours, key=cv2.contourArea)
rect = cv2.minAreaRect(contour)
box = cv2.boxPoints(rect)
box = np.int32(box)  # Use np.int32 instead of np.int0

# Draw the bounding box (for visualization purposes)
cv2.drawContours(image, [box], -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)

# Display the image with the bounding box
cv2.imshow("Target Detection", image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()



"""
#### Explanation:
- **Canny Edge Detection**: Detects the edges of objects in the image.
- **Contours**: Finds the contours of objects (in this case, the target) and allows you to extract their coordinates.
- **Bounding Box**: Using `cv2.minAreaRect()` and `cv2.boxPoints()`, we can find the rectangle surrounding the target and use it as the region for perspective correction.

### Conclusion:
To stabilize and align the target, you need to:
1. Detect the target in the image (either manually or automatically).
2. Find the corners or key points of the target.
3. Compute a homography to transform the target to a straight, aligned view.
4. Apply the transformation to the image.

This process can correct for varying angles of view and make the target appear directly in front of the camera.
